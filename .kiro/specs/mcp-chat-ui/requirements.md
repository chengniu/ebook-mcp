# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a web-based chat interface that enables users to interact with frontier LLMs (OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter) while seamlessly integrating with local MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. The system provides a secure, user-controlled environment where AI models can call tools through MCP servers with explicit user confirmation before execution.

The chat UI follows a three-tier architecture: React frontend for user interaction, Next.js backend for session management and LLM communication, and local MCP servers for tool execution. This design ensures data privacy by keeping all processing local while providing a modern, intuitive chat experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have conversations with AI models through a web chat interface, so that I can interact naturally with LLMs in a familiar chat format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the chat application THEN I SHALL see a clean chat interface with message history and input field
2. WHEN I type a message and press send THEN the system SHALL display my message immediately and show a loading indicator
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat history with proper formatting
4. WHEN I scroll through chat history THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling and auto-scroll to new messages
5. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the system SHALL preserve my chat session and message history

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my LLM provider and API credentials, so that I can use my preferred AI service with my own API keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to configure OpenAI, DeepSeek, and OpenRouter providers
2. WHEN I enter API credentials THEN the system SHALL securely store them locally without transmitting to external servers
3. WHEN I test my API configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the connection and display success/error status
4. WHEN I create a new chat THEN the system SHALL allow me to select the LLM provider and specific model that supports tool calling
5. IF my API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent chat attempts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect to my local MCP servers, so that AI models can access and use tools I have installed locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure MCP server settings THEN the system SHALL support JSON configuration format for server definitions
2. WHEN I specify MCP servers THEN the system SHALL allow me to define server commands, arguments, and environment variables
3. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically connect to configured MCP servers using StdioClientTransport
4. WHEN MCP servers are connected THEN the system SHALL list available tools and their schemas
5. WHEN an MCP server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display connection status and retry options
6. WHEN I update MCP configuration THEN the system SHALL reconnect to servers without requiring app restart

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want explicit control over tool execution, so that I can review and approve any actions before they are performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI model requests to use a tool THEN the system SHALL pause execution and display a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN I see a tool confirmation THEN it SHALL show the tool name, description, and parameters clearly
3. WHEN I click "Run" THEN the system SHALL execute the tool and continue the conversation with results
4. WHEN I click "Cancel" THEN the system SHALL abort the tool call and inform the AI that the action was cancelled
5. WHEN a tool executes THEN the system SHALL display both the tool output and the AI's interpretation of results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to handle tool calls gracefully, so that conversations flow naturally even when tools are involved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool is pending confirmation THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the conversation is paused
2. WHEN a tool executes successfully THEN the system SHALL show the tool result and continue the conversation seamlessly
3. WHEN a tool fails THEN the system SHALL display the error and allow the AI to respond appropriately
4. WHEN multiple tools are requested THEN the system SHALL handle them sequentially with individual confirmations
5. WHEN I have a long conversation with tools THEN the system SHALL maintain context and conversation flow

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be built with modern web technologies, so that it's maintainable and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the frontend THEN the system SHALL use React with TypeScript for type safety
2. WHEN building the backend THEN the system SHALL use Next.js API routes for server functionality
3. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use Zustand for predictable state management
4. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for consistent design
5. WHEN handling MCP communication THEN the system SHALL use @modelcontextprotocol/sdk for protocol compliance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to remain private and secure, so that my conversations and API keys are not exposed to external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the application THEN all processing SHALL occur locally without sending data to external servers
2. WHEN I store API keys THEN they SHALL be encrypted and stored only in local browser storage
3. WHEN MCP tools execute THEN they SHALL run on my local machine with my permissions
4. WHEN I close the application THEN sensitive data SHALL be cleared from memory appropriately
5. WHEN I export chat history THEN it SHALL be saved locally without cloud synchronization
### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive interface, so that I can use the chat application effectively on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the application on desktop THEN it SHALL provide a full-featured interface with sidebar navigation
2. WHEN I use the application on mobile THEN it SHALL adapt to smaller screens with appropriate touch interactions
3. WHEN I interact with UI elements THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and loading states
4. WHEN I navigate between sections THEN the transitions SHALL be smooth and maintain context
5. WHEN I use keyboard shortcuts THEN common actions SHALL be accessible (Enter to send, Escape to cancel)

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my chat history and sessions, so that I can organize and revisit my conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new chat THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a descriptive title using the LLM based on the conversation content
2. WHEN I view my chat history THEN the system SHALL display a list of previous conversations with their auto-generated titles
3. WHEN I click on a chat in history THEN the system SHALL load the complete conversation with all messages and context
4. WHEN I want to organize chats THEN the system SHALL allow me to rename, delete, or archive conversations
5. WHEN I search through chat history THEN the system SHALL provide text search across conversation titles and content
